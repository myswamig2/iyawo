      Four Cowrie Divination System is the doorway to many other divination technologies. Orisha Pele and Obi Orisha are divination implements specifically for Iyawo and can be learned by those with initiations such as Ilekes, Warriors or a Hand of Ifa. Orisha Pele and Obi Orisha are for those desiring more after becoming proficient in Four Cowrie Divination. These two New divination systems are revealed for diasporians and are useful to them as they pause to integrate principles such as Orisha, Neter, Odu and other spiritual systems before accepting the call to priesthood when appropriate. Be clear....THE PRIESTHOOD IS CALLING. This course is designed to be disruptive and inconvenient to your current life style. Its purpose is to put more of a priority on the practices of a functioning priest. Only a few will meet the requirement and receive Certification from SwamiG Institute. Life changing results ARE GUARANTEED!
